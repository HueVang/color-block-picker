# Color Block Picker

##Description
### Base Mode
Created a color block picker which asks a user to click on the correct block color. <br />
If correctly picked, a new statement appears asking for a different colored block to be chosen. <br />

### Hard Mode
Made it easy to add/remove blocks and colors in the app.js file by placing the colors in an array <br />
and writing a 'for' loop that adds blocks equal to the number of values in the array. <br />

### Pro Mode
Used the setTimeout() function to fadeOut/fadeIn a block if it were the correct color.
